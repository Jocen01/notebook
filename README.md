# Notebook
Collection of algoritms for competative programing implemented mostly in python. With exeption to Closest pair which is in rust and KMP wich is in C++. 
Everything in python is implemented as stand alone methods or classes which can be copied in to a problem without extra imports.

## Datastructures 
* Fenwic Tree
* Fegment Tree
* RMQ 

## Geometry   
* Closest Pair - Rust
* Convex Hull
* Polygon Area
* Point In Polygon

## Graph 
* 2-Sat
* BFS
* DAG
* Min-Max Flow
* Dijikstras
* MST, Kruskal union-find
* Strongly Connected Components, kosaraju

## Math  
* Millerâ€“Rabin primality test
* Primesive
* GCD
* FFT

## Strings
